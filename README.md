This repository contains Python notebooks to demonstrate access to NEII services.

### Repository Structure ###

This repository contains two main branches:
* master - contains the master versions of the .ipynb files (jupyter-notebooks). Changes to the notebooks should be made in this branch.
* gh-pages - contains a landing page and HTML versions of the jupyter-notebooks. HTML versions of the notebooks are created using the jupyter-nbconvert command and saved to this branch.
e.g. jupyter-nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb

The gh-pages branch is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages here: https://neii-tools.github.io/neii-notebooks/
